# SuperStarTrek Tests (Apr. 2022 â€“ Jun. 2022)

- This is a class project for implementing tests for an open source project. We are working with the SuperStarTrek game from the **https://github.com/coding-horror/basic-computer-games** open source repo. You can find their details in their README file for the [BASIC Computer Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_Computer_Games) update project!

## Project goals

Implement full testing environment for the game in `Java`, including, but not limited to 

1. `Regression and Unit Testing`
2. `Mutant`
3. `Code Flow Graphs`
4. `Truth Tables`
5. `Test Plans`
6. `Lessons Learned`

## Key Contributions
- Implemented automated unit tests for various functionalities increasing code coverage.
- Refactored code as needed to make the code testable.
- Conducted boundary testing and analysis to ensure that the game works as intended in various scenarios.
- Conducted decision/condition coverage to test all possible outcomes of the game.
- Used mocking techniques to simulate different scenarios and test the game's behavior.
- Conducted mutation testing to verify that the code can withstand changes.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- JUnit
- Mockito
- Pitest
- IntelliJ
